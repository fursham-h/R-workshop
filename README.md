# R Basics for Data Analysis [Workshop]

## **Interested in learning R for data analysis but unsure where to begin?**

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to perform 
basic data manipulation and data visualisation using R 
programming. Don't worry if you are not familiar with 
R programming, I employ simple and effective materials 
for you to be able to perform data analysis on your own in no time.

### What is the structure of this workshop?
There are 3 key lessons in this workshop (click on each of the lessons for an overview);

1. [Basics of R programming](https://fursham-h.github.io/R-workshop/articles/1_RBasics/Overview.html)
2. [Data manipulation using R](https://fursham-h.github.io/R-workshop/articles/2_DataManipulation/Overview.html)
3. [Data visualisation using R](https://fursham-h.github.io/R-workshop/articles/3_DataVisualisation/Overview.html)

Each lesson is 2 hours long, and will be conducted via Zoom (details will be given upon registration).
I charge £30 per lesson, but a £15 discount will be given if you sign up for all three lessons.

### When are lessons conducted?
